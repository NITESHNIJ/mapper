## About the Project 
This repository contains the code for the Node.js, Express.js & Mongoose part of the project. The project was built during summer internship 2020 at IIT Jodhpur, India.

THe project is made to automate the process of data collection and transfer from IOT devices to server. The front end (built by me, code present in other Repo.) servers for the interface for the fetures provided by the application.

The project uses Passport for authentication information and MongoDB Database.

The database is designed by me and the structure was made keeping ormalization in mind.

## Tech Used
To build the Rest API we use Node.js and Express.js.
MongoDB Database is used to store data.
Passport is used to take care os user authentication, signup and login.

This repositor was hosted on Azure cloud. (Currently down due to end of free student credentials).
